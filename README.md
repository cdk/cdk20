# CDK 20th Birthday

**Why**: In 2020, the Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) will have its 20th Birthday. That should be celebrated. 

**What**: We suggest to hold a symposium “20 years of CDK - Open Source Cheminformatics in the 21st century”.

**Who**:  We want to bring together as many CDK enthusiasts as possible as well as colleagues from other OS Cheminformatics projects.
